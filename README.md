# weqe_botki

weqe_botkit is a python library meant to easen the creation of bots within the Cisco Webex for Teams using python(popularly Cisco spark). 

There have been previous solutions that have been implemented but the main issue being the creation of constant webhooks. This prject plans to use Flask to maintain and listen on these webhooks and thus one can receive immediate update when e.g a message is sent to the bot. This solution is also meant to be minimalistic and will only go more that five files if conditioins force this to happen. We hope to give you a good python3 webex solution by the end of this project. 

*Development is currently underway, join in if interested. Documentation will be out soon enough*
